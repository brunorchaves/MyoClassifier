# MyoClassifier

## Overview
MyoClassifier is a machine learning project designed to classify electromyography (EMG) signals. The project leverages various algorithms and techniques to accurately identify different types of muscle movements based on the EMG data.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- **src/**: Source code for the project, including data processing, feature extraction, and model implementation.
  - **data_processing/**: Scripts for loading and preprocessing the EMG data.
  - **feature_extraction/**: Scripts for extracting features from the EMG signals.
  - **models/**: Implementation of various machine learning models used for classification.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions and helper scripts.
  - **examples/**: Example scripts and notebooks adapted from the `pyomyo` repository to demonstrate usage and integration.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for the project's codebase.
- **README.md**: Project documentation and overview.

## Getting Started
To get started with the MyoClassifier project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyoClassifier.git
   cd MyoClassifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks**:
   Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and train the models.

4. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Usage
The main scripts for data processing, feature extraction, and model training can be found in the `src/` directory. You can run these scripts individually or integrate them into your own workflow.
